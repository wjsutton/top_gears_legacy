 ### :thinking: Known Issues
 
 - Top Gear 2014 Patagonia Special: Part 1 & 2 has no season
 - Top Gear 2012 50 Years of Bond Cars has no season
 - One Top Gear season includes two 'best of top gear' episodes, which should be seasonless to be consistent with all other 'best ofs'

Data shows:
- Fans overly negative to season when Chris Evans was the host
- The Grand Tour continued on the same ratings trend but with many more users submitting ratings
- The episodes that are my favourites (some of the early seasons 'buy 3 car challenges') have much poor ratings compared to later seasons
