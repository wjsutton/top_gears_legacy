### :-1: Abandoning Repo

While I believe there is some interesting in a workflows for IMDB data and Top Gear/The Grand Tour is a reasonable example, the story behind the data (negative reaction by fans for a change in casting) lacks any calls to action other than highlighting an underperforming cast. For this reason I don't feel the story is worth sharing in a visual format.

 ### :thinking: Known Issues
 
 - Top Gear 2014 Patagonia Special: Part 1 & 2 has no season
 - Top Gear 2012 50 Years of Bond Cars has no season
 - One Top Gear season includes two 'best of top gear' episodes, which should be seasonless to be consistent with all other 'best ofs'

Data shows:
- Fans overly negative to season when Chris Evans was the host
- The Grand Tour continued on the same ratings trend but with many more users submitting ratings
- The episodes that are my favourites (some of the early seasons 'buy 3 car challenges') have much poor ratings compared to later seasons
